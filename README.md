# Game Name:
Spaceship.io

# Description:
Spaceship.io is a program created by Elon Musk to find the best commander in the galaxy. The winner will gain a spot as a driver in the last SpaceX's mission: "Beyond the earth". The mission has the objective to preserve the human race sending a bank of fertilized eggs to the planet LH2025, the last hope of the specie.

The program is a sort of battle royale where you must defeat the other participants to become the last spaceship standing.

# Gameplay Tutorial:
Join the server and start destroying other spaceships with your laser-gun. If an enemy is destroyed it will drop an orb, with witch you can restore your life.

You're lucky to have the "Mandalorian's laser gun", the latest model of laser-guns with the following capabilities:
- Press left: Front laser
- Press Right: Back laser
- Press Up: Special shot (try it!)
- Press Down: Move forward (the laser-gun can also move your spaceship!)

Don't get destroyed and become a hero!
